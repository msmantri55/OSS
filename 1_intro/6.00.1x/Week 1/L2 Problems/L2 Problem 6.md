For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, or if the evaluation would lead to an error, write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string). While you could simply type these expressions into an Idle shell, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.

`"a" + "bc"`

'abc'

`3 * "bc"`

bcbcbc

`"3" * "bc"`

error

`"abcd"[2]`

c

`"abcd"[0:2]`

ab

`"abcd"[:2]`

ab

`"abcd"[2:]`

cd
