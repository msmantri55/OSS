**What is the difference between an Algorithm and a Program?**

* An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.

**True or False? A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.**

* True

**True or False? Computer Science is the study of how to build efficient machines that run programs.**

* False

**The two things every computer can do are:**

* Perform calculations
* Remember the results

**True or False? Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact.**

* True

**True or False? Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods.**

* True

**True or False? A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own.**

* True

**True or False? A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.**

* False

**True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.**

* False

**A program counter**

* points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.

**What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?**

* The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.

**True or False? In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.**

* False

**Syntax:** Determines whether a string is legal

**Static semantics:** Determines whether a string has meaning

**Semantics:** Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence
