Consider the following code specification:

```
def size(aSet):
   """
   aSet is a collection of objects, which might be empty.
   Objects are assumed to be of the same type.
   """
```

Here is a set of possible test cases to include in a black box test suite. Indicate which of the following conditions would make a good black box test suite for the function size by clicking on the appropriate choice(s).

**Empty set**
**Set of size 1**
Set of odd size
Set of even size
**Set of size greater than 1**
Set whose size is a prime number 

Empty set , Set of size 1 , Set of size greater than 1 , - This answer is correct.
