# Problem 3-1

Examine the following code snippet:

```
  stuff  = _____
  for thing in stuff:
        if thing == 'iQ':
           print "Found it"
```

Select all the values of the variable "stuff" that will make the code print "Found it".

* ["iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad"]
* ("iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad")
* [ ( "iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad") ]
* ( [ "iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad" ], )
* ["iQ"]
* "iQ"

# Problem 3-2

The following Python code is supposed to compute the square of an integer by using successive additions.

```
def Square(x):
    return SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x))

def SquareHelper(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return SquareHelper(n-1, x) + x
```

Not considering recursion depth limitations, what is wrong with this implementation of procedure Square? Check all that apply.

* It is going to return a wrong value.
* The term `Square` is a reserved Python keyword.
* Function names cannot start with a capital letter.
* The function is never going to return anything.
* Python has arbitrary precision arithmetic.
* This function will not work for negative numbers.
* The call `SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x))` won't work because you can't have `abs(x)` as both parameters.
* Nothing is wrong; the code is fine as-is. , - This answer is correct.
