# Problem 1-1

The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it returns the correct answer.

* True
* **False**

# Problem 1-2

Roughly speaking, under the RAM model of computation, adding two numbers takes the same amount of time as dividing them.

* **True**
* False

# Problem 1-3

When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for the one with the largest growth rate.

* **True**
* False

# Problem 1-4

Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity

* True
* **False**

# Problem 1-5

For large values of `n`, an algorithm that takes `20000n^2` steps has better time complexity (takes less time) than one that takes `0.001n^5` steps

* **True**
* False
